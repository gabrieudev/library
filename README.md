## Features

- User registration confirmation via email.
- Search functionality with pagination.
- Endpoints documentation using Swagger.
- User login with JWT authentication.
- Role-based authorization to control access to different API endpoints.
- Password encryption following industry best practices.
- Integration with PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your machine:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gabrieudev/library.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <path>`
3. Update general settings in `application.properties`.
4. Build the project: `./mvnw clean install` (for Windows: `mvnw.cmd clean install`)
5. Run the application: `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (for Windows: `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`)

## Configuration

- Database and JavaMailSender: Update the `application.properties` file with your PostgreSQL database and JavaMailSender information.

## Usage

1. When the project starts, an admin user is automatically inserted into the database in `AdminDataLoader.java`. You can change its information either there or in `application.properties`.
2. Use an admin role user to access protected endpoints.
